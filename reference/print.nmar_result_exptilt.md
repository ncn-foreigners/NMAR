shows a concise, human-friendly summary of the estimation result
together with exptilt-specific diagnostics (loss, iterations) and a
compact view of the response coefficients stored in the fitted model.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'nmar_result_exptilt'
print(x, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An object of class \`nmar_result_exptilt\`.

- ...:

  Ignored.

## Value

\`x\`, invisibly.
