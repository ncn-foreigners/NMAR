# Polish Household Budget Data with Simulated Nonignorable Nonresponse

This dataset is derived from the \`h05\` dataset (Polish household
budgets for 2005) found in the \`RClas\` package. The original data was
cleaned to remove all rows with missing values.

## Usage

``` r

```

## Format

A data frame with 19,330 rows and 17 columns. The key variables are:

- income:

- expenditure:

- y_exp:

  Numeric. The \*\*true\*\* scaled expenditure (\`expenditure /
  mean(expenditure)\`). This is the complete study variable without
  missingness.

- resp:

  TODO

- R:

  Integer. The simulated response indicator (1=responded,
  0=nonresponse).

- y_exp_miss:

  Numeric. The \*\*observed\*\* scaled expenditure, containing 7,778
  \`NA\` values where \`R = 0\`. This is the variable to be used as the
  NMAR-affected outcome.

## Details

To create a realistic test case for nonignorable nonresponse (NMAR), a
nonresponse mechanism was simulated and applied to the scaled
expenditure variable (\`y_exp\`).

The key simulation steps were: 1. \`y_exp\` (true study variable) was
created by scaling total expenditure. 2. A true response probability
(\`resp\`) was created using the logistic model: \`plogis(1 - 0.6 \*
y_exp)\`. 3. A response indicator (\`R\`) was simulated based on this
probability. 4. The final variable \`y_exp_miss\` was generated by
setting \`y_exp\` to \`NA\` wherever \`R\` was 0.

The response is \*\*nonignorable\*\* because the probability of
missingness depends directly on the value of the expenditure variable
itself.
