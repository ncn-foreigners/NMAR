\description{
Empirical likelihood estimating equations
}
\details{
Returns a function that evaluates the stacked EL system for
  \eqn{\theta = (\beta, z, \lambda_x)} with \eqn{z = \operatorname{logit}(W)}.
  Blocks correspond to: (i) missingness (response) model score equations in \eqn{\beta},
  (ii) the response-rate equation in \eqn{W}, and (iii) auxiliary moment
  constraints in \eqn{\lambda_x}. When no auxiliaries are present the last
  block is omitted. The system matches Qin, Leung, and Shao (2002, Eqs. 7-10)
  with empirical masses \eqn{m_i = d_i/D_i(\theta)}, \eqn{D_i} as in the paper.
  We cap \eqn{\eta}, clip \eqn{p}, and guard \eqn{D_i} away from zero to
  ensure numerical stability; these safeguards are applied consistently in
  equations, Jacobian, and post-solution weights.

  Guarding policy (must remain consistent across equations/Jacobian/post):
  - Cap eta: eta <- pmax(pmin(eta, get_eta_cap()), -get_eta_cap())
  - Compute w <- family$linkinv(eta); clip to [1e-12, 1-1e-12] when used in ratios
  - Denominator floor: Di <- pmax(Di_raw, nmar_get_el_denom_floor()); in the
    Jacobian, multiply terms that depend on d(1/Di)/d(.) by
    active = 1(Di_raw > floor)

  The score with respect to the linear predictor uses the Bernoulli form
  \eqn{s_{\eta,i}(\beta) = \partial \log w_i / \partial \eta_i = \mu.\eta(\eta_i)/w_i},
  which is valid for both logit and probit links when \eqn{w_i} is clipped.
