\description{
Implements the core computational engine for empirical likelihood estimation
under nonignorable nonresponse, including parameter solving, variance calculation,
and diagnostic computation.
}
\details{
Orchestrates EL estimation for NMAR following Qin, Leung, and Shao (2002).
For \code{data.frame} inputs (IID setting) the stacked system in
\eqn{(\beta, z, \lambda_x)} with \eqn{z = \logit(W)} is solved by
\code{nleqslv} using an analytic Jacobian. For \code{survey.design} inputs a
design-weighted analogue in \eqn{(\beta, z, \lambda_W, \lambda_x)} is solved
with an analytic Jacobian when the response family supplies second
derivatives, or with numeric/Broyden Jacobians otherwise. Numerical
safeguards are applied consistently across equations, Jacobian, and
post-solution weights: bounded linear predictors, probability clipping in
ratios, and a small floor on denominators \eqn{D_i(\theta)} with an
active-set mask in derivatives. After solving, unnormalized masses
\eqn{d_i/D_i(\theta)} are formed, optional trimming may be applied (with
normalization only for reporting), and optional variance is computed via
bootstrap when \code{variance_method = "bootstrap"}.
