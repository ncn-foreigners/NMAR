\usage{
el_engine(
  standardize = TRUE,
  trim_cap = Inf,
  on_failure = c("return", "error"),
  variance_method = c("bootstrap", "none"),
  bootstrap_reps = 500,
  auxiliary_means = NULL,
  control = list(),
  strata_augmentation = TRUE,
  n_total = NULL,
  start = NULL,
  family = c("logit", "probit")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{standardize}{logical; standardize predictors. Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{trim_cap}{numeric; cap for EL weights (\code{Inf} = no trimming).}

\item{on_failure}{character; \code{"return"} or \code{"error"} on solver failure.}

\item{variance_method}{character; one of \code{"bootstrap"} or \code{"none"}.}

\item{bootstrap_reps}{integer; number of bootstrap replicates when
\code{variance_method = "bootstrap"}.}

\item{auxiliary_means}{named numeric vector; population means for auxiliary
design columns. Names must match the materialized model.matrix column names
on the first RHS (after formula expansion), e.g., factor indicator columns
created by \code{model.matrix()} or transformed terms like \code{I(X^2)}.
Auxiliary intercepts are always dropped automatically, so do not supply
\code{(Intercept)}. If \code{NULL} (default)
and the outcome contains at least one \code{NA}, auxiliary means are estimated
from the full input (including nonrespondents): IID uses unweighted column
means of the auxiliary design; survey designs use the design-weighted means
based on \code{weights(design)}. This corresponds to the QLS case where
\eqn{\mu_x} is replaced by \eqn{\bar X} (the full-sample mean) when auxiliary
variables are observed for all sampled units.}

\item{control}{Optional solver configuration forwarded to
\code{nleqslv::nleqslv()}. Provide a single list that may include solver
tolerances (e.g., \code{xtol}, \code{ftol}, \code{maxit}) and, optionally,
top-level entries \code{global} and \code{xscalm} for globalization and
scaling. Example:
\code{control = list(maxit = 500, xtol = 1e-10, ftol = 1e-10, global = "qline", xscalm = "auto")}.}

\item{strata_augmentation}{logical; when \code{TRUE} (default), survey designs
with an identifiable strata structure are augmented with stratum indicators
and corresponding population shares in the auxiliary block (Wu-style
strata augmentation). Has no effect for \code{data.frame} inputs or
survey designs without strata.}

\item{n_total}{numeric; optional when supplying respondents-only data (no \code{NA} in the
outcome). For \code{data.frame} inputs, set to the total number of sampled units
before filtering to respondents. For \code{survey.design} inputs, set to the total
design-weight total on the same analysis scale as \code{weights(design)}
(default \code{sum(weights(design))}). If omitted and the outcome contains no NAs,
the estimator errors, requesting \code{n_total}.}

\item{start}{list; optional starting point for the solver. Fields:
\itemize{
  \item \code{beta}: named numeric vector of missingness-model coefficients on the
    original (unscaled) scale, including \code{(Intercept)}.
  \item \code{W} or \code{z}: starting value for population response rate (\code{0 < W < 1})
    or its logit (\code{z}). If both are provided, \code{z} takes precedence.
  \item \code{lambda}: named numeric vector of auxiliary multipliers on the original
    scale (names must match auxiliary design columns; no intercept). Values
    are mapped to the scaled space internally.
}}

\item{family}{Missingness (response) model family. Either \code{"logit"}
(default) or \code{"probit"}, or a custom family object: a list with
components \code{name}, \code{linkinv}, \code{mu.eta}, \code{score_eta}, and
optionally \code{d2mu.deta2}. When \code{d2mu.deta2} is absent the solver
uses Broyden/numeric Jacobians.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{"nmar_engine_el"} (also inheriting from \code{"nmar_engine"})
containing configuration fields to be supplied to \code{nmar()}. Users rarely
access fields directly; instead, pass the engine to \code{nmar()} together with a
formula and data.
}
\description{
Constructs an engine specification for the empirical likelihood (EL)
estimator of a full-data mean under nonignorable nonresponse (NMAR).
}
\details{
The implementation follows Qin, Leung, and Shao (2002): the response
mechanism is modeled as \eqn{w(y, x; \beta) = P(R = 1 \mid Y = y, X = x)} and
the joint law of \eqn{(Y, X)} is represented nonparametrically by respondent
masses that satisfy empirical likelihood constraints. The mean is estimated
as a respondent weighted mean with weights proportional to
\eqn{\tilde w_i = a_i / D_i(\beta, W, \lambda)}, where \eqn{a_i} are base
weights (\eqn{a_i \equiv 1} for IID data and \eqn{a_i = d_i} for survey
designs) and \eqn{D_i} is the EL denominator.

For \code{data.frame} inputs the estimator solves the Qin-Leung-Shao (QLS)
estimating equations for \eqn{(\beta, W, \lambda_x)} with \eqn{W} reparameterized
as \eqn{z = \operatorname{logit}(W)}, and profiles out the response multiplier
\eqn{\lambda_W} using the closed-form QLS identity (their Eq. 10). For
\code{survey.design} inputs the estimator uses a design-weighted analogue
(Chen and Sitter 1999; Wu 2005) with an explicit \eqn{\lambda_W} and an
additional linkage equation involving the nonrespondent design-weight total
\eqn{T_0}.

Numerical stability:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{W} is optimized on the logit scale so \eqn{0 < W < 1}.
  \item The response-model linear predictor is capped and EL denominators
    \eqn{D_i} are floored at a small positive value; the analytic Jacobian is
    consistent with this guard via an active-set mask.
  \item Optional trimming (\code{trim_cap}) is applied only after solving, to
    the unnormalized masses \eqn{\tilde w_i = a_i/D_i}; this changes the
    returned weights and therefore the point estimate.

\strong{Formula syntax and data constraints}: \code{nmar()} accepts a
partitioned right-hand side \code{y_miss ~ auxiliaries | response_only}. Variables
left of \code{|} enter auxiliary moment constraints; variables right of \code{|}
enter only the response model. The outcome (LHS) is always included as a
response-model predictor through the evaluated LHS expression; explicit use of
the outcome on the RHS is rejected. The response model always includes an
intercept; the auxiliary block never includes an intercept.

To include a covariate in both the auxiliary constraints and the response
model, repeat it on both sides, e.g. \code{y_miss ~ X | X}.

\strong{Auxiliary means}: If \code{auxiliary_means = NULL} (default) and the
outcome contains at least one \code{NA}, auxiliary means are estimated from the
full input and used as \eqn{\bar X} in the QLS constraints. For respondents-only
data (no \code{NA} in the outcome), \code{n_total} must be supplied; and if the
auxiliary RHS is non-empty, \code{auxiliary_means} must also be supplied.
When \code{standardize = TRUE}, supply \code{auxiliary_means} on the original
data scale; the engine applies the same standardization internally.

\strong{Survey scale}: For \code{survey.design} inputs, \code{n_total} (if
provided) must be on the same analysis scale as \code{weights(design)}. The
default is \code{sum(weights(design))}.

\strong{Convergence and identification}: the stacked EL system can have
multiple solutions. Adding response-only predictors (variables to the right
of \code{|}) can make the problem sensitive to starting values. Inspect
diagnostics such as \code{jacobian_condition_number} and consider supplying
\code{start = list(beta = ..., W = ...)} when needed.

\strong{Variance}: The EL engine supports bootstrap standard errors via
\code{variance_method = "bootstrap"} or can skip variance with
\code{variance_method = "none"}.
Set a seed for reproducible bootstrap results.

Bootstrap requires suggested packages: for IID resampling it requires
\code{future.apply} (and \code{future}); for survey replicate-weight bootstrap
it requires \code{survey} and \code{svrep}.
