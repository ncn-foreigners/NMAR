\title{Not Missing at Random (NMAR)}
\usage{
nmar(
  method,
  data,
  outcome_variable,
  covariates_for_outcome,
  covariates_for_missingness,
  settings
)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{A character string specifying the NMAR imputation method to use.
Currently, only `"exptilt"` (Exponential Tilting) is supported.}

\item{data}{A data frame or matrix containing the dataset. Missing values in
the `outcome_variable` should be represented by `NA`.}

\item{outcome_variable}{A character string specifying the name of the single
target (outcome) column that may contain missing values.}

\item{covariates_for_outcome}{A character vector of column names for the
covariates that are used in the conditional density model of the
`outcome_variable`}

\item{covariates_for_missingness}{A character vector of column names for
additional variables (apart from the `outcome_variable`) that are used to
model the observation probability (i.e., the missingness mechanism).}

\item{settings}{A `list` of control parameters specific to the chosen `method`.
For `method = "exptilt"`, this list can contain the following elements
(all with sensible defaults if not provided):
\itemize{
  \item{\strong{`prob_model_type`}}{ (`character`): Type of probability model for the missingness mechanism.
        Valid options: `"logit"` (for logistic regression, default) or `"probit"` (for probit regression).}
  \item{\strong{`y_dens`}}{ (`character`): Type of conditional density model for the `outcome_variable`
        given `covariates_for_outcome`. Valid options: `"normal"` (for a normal distribution, default)
        or `"gamma"` (for a gamma distribution).}
  \item{\strong{`tol_value`}}{ (`numeric`): Tolerance value for the convergence criterion in the
        iterative optimization process. Default is `0.00001`.}
  \item{\strong{`min_iter`}}{ (`integer`): Minimum number of iterations for the `nleqslv`
        optimization algorithm. Default is `10`.}
  \item{\strong{`max_iter`}}{ (`integer`): Maximum number of iterations for the `nleqslv`
        optimization algorithm. Default is `100`.}
  \item{\strong{`optim_method`}}{ (`character`): Optimization method to be used by `nleqslv`.
        Valid options: `"Newton"` (default) or `"Broyden`".}
}
Any element not specified in `settings` will revert to its default value for the chosen method.}
}
\value{
A `list` object containing the results of the NMAR imputation. The exact
  structure of the returned list depends on the chosen `method`.
  For `method = "exptilt"`, the list typically includes:
  \itemize{
    \item{\strong{`theta`}}{ The estimated tilting parameters.}
    \item{\strong{`est_mean`}}{ The estimated mean of the imputed `outcome_variable`.}
    \item{\strong{`loss_value`}}{ The final loss function value from the
      optimization, indicating convergence status.}
  }
}
\description{
This function serves as the primary interface for performing
  Missing Not At Random (NMAR) data estimation.
}
\details{
The `nmar` function acts as a dispatcher, forwarding the imputation task to
  specific internal functions based on the `method` argument.
  It enforces strict input validation to ensure robust and predictable behavior.

  The Exponential Tilting (ET) method (`"exptilt"`) addresses Missing Not At Random
  (NMAR) data in a single outcome variable by iteratively estimating model
  parameters for the missingness mechanism and the conditional distribution of
  the outcome, simultaneously imputing the missing values.
  This approach assumes specific model structures for the missingness indicator
  and the conditional density of the outcome, as configured via `settings`.
  Users should ensure that `covariates_for_outcome` and `covariates_for_missingness`
  contain only fully observed variables.
