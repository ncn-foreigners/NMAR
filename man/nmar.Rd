\title{Not Missing at Random (NMAR) Estimation}
\usage{
nmar(formula, data, engine, trace_level = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A two-sided formula of the form `y_miss ~ aux1 + aux2 | z1 + z2`.
The left-hand side is the outcome (with `NA` values indicating nonresponse).
The right-hand side is split by `|` into two parts:
- left of `|`: auxiliary variables (enter moment constraints);
- right of `|`: missingness (response) model predictors (enter the missingness model only).
If `|` is omitted, only auxiliary variables are used for both parsing and printing.
The outcome variable is implicitly included in the response model.}

\item{data}{A data frame or `survey.design` containing the variables referenced by the
formula.}

\item{engine}{An engine configuration object, typically created by an
engine constructor function like `exptilt()`. This object defines the
specific NMAR estimation method and its parameters. It must inherit from
class `nmar_engine`.}

\item{trace_level}{Integer 0-3; controls verbosity level during estimation (default: 1):
\itemize{
  \item 0: No output (silent mode)
  \item 1: Major steps only (initialization, convergence, final results)
  \item 2: Moderate detail (iteration summaries, key diagnostics)
  \item 3: Full detail (all diagnostics, intermediate values)
}}
}
\value{
An object containing the estimation results, whose structure will be
  specific to the `engine` used. This might include estimated parameters,
  convergence information, and other relevant output from the chosen NMAR method.
}
\description{
Provides a unified interface for Not Missing at Random (NMAR) estimation.
  This function orchestrates the estimation process by validating inputs and
  dispatching to the appropriate engine based on the provided `engine` object.
  It ensures that all necessary data and model specifications are correctly
  formatted before computation begins.
