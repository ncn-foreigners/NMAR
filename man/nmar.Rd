\title{Not Missing at Random (NMAR) Estimation}
\usage{
nmar(formula, data, engine)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A named list of formulas specifying the model components.
It must contain:
\itemize{
  \item `outcome`: A formula for the outcome variable (e.g., `~ Y`).
  \item `covariates_outcome`: A formula for covariates affecting the outcome (e.g., `~ x1 + x2`).
  \item `covariates_missingness`: A formula for covariates affecting the missingness mechanism.
    Use `NULL` if no specific covariates are used for missingness (e.g., in some NMAR models,
    missingness depends implicitly on the outcome itself).
}}

\item{data}{A data frame containing all variables specified in the `formula`.}

\item{engine}{An engine configuration object, typically created by an
engine constructor function like `exptilt()`. This object defines the
specific NMAR estimation method and its parameters. It must inherit from
class `nmar_engine`.}
}
\value{
An object containing the estimation results, whose structure will be
  specific to the `engine` used. This might include estimated parameters,
  convergence information, and other relevant output from the chosen NMAR method.
}
\description{
Provides a unified interface for Not Missing at Random (NMAR) estimation.
  This function orchestrates the estimation process by validating inputs and
  dispatching to the appropriate engine based on the provided `engine` object.
  It ensures that all necessary data and model specifications are correctly
  formatted before computation begins.
}
\examples{
# First, create an engine configuration for Exponential Tilting
# (assuming 'exptilt' function is defined as below)
exptilt_config <- exptilt(
  prob_model_type = 'probit',
  y_dens = 'normal',
  tol_value = 0.00001,
  min_iter = 30,
  max_iter = 100
)

# Create some example data
set.seed(123)
n_obs <- 100
example_data <- data.frame(
  Y = rnorm(n_obs),
  x1 = rnorm(n_obs),
  x2 = runif(n_obs)
)

# Define the formulas
model_formula <- list(
  outcome = ~ Y,
  covariates_outcome = ~ x1 + x2,
  covariates_missingness = NULL # Or specify if you have covariates for missingness
)

# Run the NMAR estimation
# Note: 'validate_nmar' and 'run_engine' are internal functions here.
# The example focuses on the user-facing call.
# res <- nmar(formula = model_formula, data = example_data, engine = exptilt_config)

# Due to the internal nature of 'validate_nmar' and 'run_engine' not being available,
# the example cannot be fully executable without the full package.
# However, this demonstrates the intended usage pattern.
# For a real scenario, you would expect 'res' to contain estimation results.
