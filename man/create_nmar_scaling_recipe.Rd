\usage{
create_nmar_scaling_recipe(
  ...,
  intercept_col = "(Intercept)",
  weights = NULL,
  weight_mask = NULL,
  tol_constant = 1e-08,
  warn_on_constant = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{one or more matrices with named columns.}

\item{intercept_col}{Intercept column name that should remain unscaled.}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of weights used to compute weighted
means/standard deviations.}

\item{weight_mask}{Optional logical/ numeric mask applied to `weights` before
computing moments (useful for respondents-only scaling).}

\item{tol_constant}{Numeric tolerance below which columns are treated as
constant and left unscaled.}

\item{warn_on_constant}{Logical; emit a warning when a column is treated as
constant.}
