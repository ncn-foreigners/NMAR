\description{
Computes the respondent-side auxiliary matrix and the population means vector
used for centering \eqn{X - \mu_x}. When \code{auxiliary_means} is supplied, only
respondent rows are required to be fully observed. NA values are permitted on
nonrespondent rows. When \code{auxiliary_means} is \code{NULL}, auxiliaries must be fully
observed in the full data used to estimate population means.
